## 🔧 Technical Details

### Provider Configuration Updates

**Before:**
```hcl
required_providers {
  azurerm = { version = "~> 3.0" }
  azuread = { version = "~> 2.0" }
}
```

**After:**
```hcl
required_providers {
  azurerm = { version = "~> 4.0" }  # Latest: 4.49.0
  azuread = { version = "~> 3.0" }  # Latest: 3.6.0
}
```

### Breaking Change Example: azuread_application_password

**Before (azuread 2.x):**
```hcl
resource "azuread_application_password" "cortex" {
  application_object_id = azuread_application.cortex.object_id
  end_date_relative     = "8760h"
}
```

**After (azuread 3.x):**
```hcl
resource "azuread_application_password" "cortex" {
  application_id = azuread_application.cortex.id
  end_date       = timeadd(timestamp(), "8760h")
  rotate_when_changed = {
    rotation = time_rotating.password_rotation.id
  }
}

resource "time_rotating" "password_rotation" {
  rotation_days = 365
}
```

### Breaking Change Example: azurerm_storage_account

**Before (azurerm 3.x):**
```hcl
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "audit_logs" {
  enable_https_traffic_only = true
}
```

**After (azurerm 4.x):**
```hcl
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "audit_logs" {
  https_traffic_only_enabled = true  # Updated property name
}
```
