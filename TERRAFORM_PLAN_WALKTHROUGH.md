# Terraform Plan Walkthrough Guide
**Project:** azure-cortex-ui
**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Purpose:** Understanding what `terraform plan` will show you

---

## üéØ Overview

This guide walks you through how to read and understand the Terraform plan output for your Azure Cortex UI deployment.

---

## üìã Prerequisites

Before running `terraform plan`, you need to provide your Azure and Cortex Cloud credentials.

### Step 1: Create `terraform.tfvars`

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars

# Edit with your actual values (DO NOT commit this file!)
nano terraform.tfvars
```

### Required Values:
```hcl
# Azure Configuration
subscription_id = "YOUR-AZURE-SUBSCRIPTION-ID"
tenant_id       = "YOUR-AZURE-TENANT-ID"

# Cortex Cloud Configuration
cortex_api_url     = "https://api.prismacloud.io"  # Or your region
cortex_access_key  = "YOUR-CORTEX-ACCESS-KEY"
cortex_secret_key  = "YOUR-CORTEX-SECRET-KEY"

# Azure Account Name
azure_account_name = "Azure-Production"
environment        = "prod"
```

### Step 2: Authenticate with Azure

```bash
# Login to Azure
az login

# Set the correct subscription
az account set --subscription YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID

# Verify
az account show
```

---

## üöÄ Running Terraform Plan

```bash
# Generate the plan
terraform plan -out=migration.tfplan

# OR save output to a file for review
terraform plan -out=migration.tfplan 2>&1 | tee plan-output.txt
```

---

## üìä Understanding the Plan Output

### Section 1: Header Information

```
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create
  ~ update in-place
  - destroy
  -/+ destroy and then create replacement

Terraform will perform the following actions:
```

**What this means:**
- **`+` (green)**: New resource will be created
- **`~` (yellow)**: Existing resource will be modified
- **`-` (red)**: Resource will be destroyed
- **`-/+` (red/green)**: Resource will be replaced (destroyed then recreated)

---

### Section 2: Resource Details

For each resource, you'll see:

```hcl
# azurerm_resource_group.cortex will be created
+ resource "azurerm_resource_group" "cortex" {
    + id       = (known after apply)
    + location = "eastus"
    + name     = "rg-cortex-prod"
    + tags     = {
        + "Environment" = "Production"
        + "ManagedBy"   = "Terraform"
        + "Project"     = "Cortex Cloud CSPM"
      }
  }
```

**Breaking this down:**
- **Resource Type**: `azurerm_resource_group` (Azure Resource Group)
- **Resource Name**: `cortex` (Terraform reference name)
- **Action**: Will be created (indicated by `+`)
- **Attributes**:
  - `id = (known after apply)` - Value won't be known until after creation
  - `location = "eastus"` - Region where it will be created
  - `name = "rg-cortex-prod"` - Actual Azure name
  - `tags` - Metadata tags

## ‚úÖ What to Look For (Quality Checks)

### ‚úÖ **Good Signs:**
1. **No Destroy Actions** - No `-` symbols (no resources deleted)
2. **No Replacements** - No `-/+` symbols (no resources recreated)
3. **All Creates** - Only `+` symbols (new resources only)
4. **Sensitive Values Hidden** - Secrets show `(sensitive value)`
5. **Logical Resource Names** - Clear, consistent naming convention
6. **Proper Scopes** - Roles assigned at correct subscription/tenant levels
7. **Security Settings** - TLS 1.2, HTTPS-only, etc.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning Signs to Review:**
1. **Any `-` (destroy)** - Investigate why resource is being deleted
2. **Any `-/+` (replace)** - May cause downtime or data loss
3. **Unexpected updates** - Check what's changing and why
4. **Missing resources** - Compare against expected list above
5. **Incorrect names** - Check environment suffix, region, etc.

### üõë **Stop If You See:**
1. **Mass destruction** - Many resources marked for deletion
2. **Permission downgrades** - Custom role losing critical permissions
3. **Security config changes** - TLS version, HTTPS enforcement disabled
4. **Unknown resources** - Resources you didn't expect

## üìù Sample Plan Review Session

Here's how a typical plan review should go:

```bash
# 1. Generate the plan
terraform plan -out=migration.tfplan 2>&1 | tee plan-output.txt

# 2. Review the summary
tail -50 plan-output.txt

# 3. Search for specific resources
grep "azuread_application.cortex" plan-output.txt
grep "azurerm_role_assignment" plan-output.txt
grep "azurerm_monitor_diagnostic_setting" plan-output.txt

# 4. Check for warnings
grep -i "warning" plan-output.txt

# 5. Check for errors
grep -i "error" plan-output.txt

# 6. Count resource actions
grep "will be created" plan-output.txt | wc -l
grep "will be updated" plan-output.txt | wc -l
grep "will be destroyed" plan-output.txt | wc -l

# 7. Review sensitive outputs
grep "(sensitive value)" plan-output.txt
```

## üéØ Decision Matrix

| Plan Output | Action | Reason |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| **Plan: 25 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy** | ‚úÖ APPLY | Perfect! All new resources, nothing destroyed |
| **Plan: 20 to add, 5 to update in-place, 0 to destroy** | ‚ö†Ô∏è REVIEW | Check what's being updated and why |
| **Plan: 25 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy** | üõë INVESTIGATE | Find out why 1 resource is being destroyed |
| **Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy** | ‚úÖ APPLY | Infrastructure already matches config (idempotent) |
| **Plan: Many resources marked for destruction** | üõë STOP | Do NOT apply - something is wrong |

---

## üöÄ Next Steps After Plan Review

### If Plan Looks Good:

```bash
# Apply the plan
terraform apply migration.tfplan

# Monitor the apply process
# Should take 3-5 minutes for all resources
```

### If Plan Shows Issues:

```bash
# Don't apply! Review the issues first
# Check:
1. Are your variables correct in terraform.tfvars?
2. Are you authenticated to the right Azure subscription?
3. Do you have the required permissions?
4. Are there any typos in variable values?

# Make corrections and re-run plan
terraform plan -out=migration.tfplan
```

---

## üí° Pro Tips

### 1. **Save Every Plan**
```bash
# Always save plans with timestamps
terraform plan -out=plans/plan-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).tfplan
```

### 2. **Review Before Bedtime**
- Generate plan at end of day
- Review it fresh in the morning
- Apply with clear head

### 3. **Use Target for Testing**
```bash
# Test one resource at a time
terraform plan -target=azurerm_resource_group.cortex
terraform apply -target=azurerm_resource_group.cortex
```

### 4. **Diff Against Previous Plans**
```bash
# Compare current plan with previous
terraform show migration.tfplan > plan-current.txt
diff plan-previous.txt plan-current.txt
```

### 5. **Validate Outputs**
```bash
# After apply, verify outputs
terraform output
terraform output -json | jq .
terraform output -raw application_secret  # Get secret value
```

---

## üÜò Common Issues

### Issue 1: "No changes" when you expect changes

**Cause:** State already matches configuration
**Solution:** This is actually good! Infrastructure is in desired state

### Issue 2: Resources marked for replacement

**Cause:** Breaking changes in provider, attribute changes
**Solution:** Review upgrade guide, may need to accept replacement

### Issue 3: "Resource not found" errors

**Cause:** Data sources can't find Azure resources
**Solution:** Verify subscription, tenant IDs, Azure CLI authentication

### Issue 4: Permission denied errors

**Cause:** Insufficient Azure permissions
**Solution:** Need Owner or User Access Administrator role
